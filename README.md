# Fayette County Public Schools Coding Standards
This repository will contain coding standards used by the Office of Data Management, Planning, and Program Evaluation.  Our goal is to not only provide full transparency in our work, but also to support the broader mission of Fayette County Public Schools as an educational institution.  We hope our work will serve as a model for other schools, local education agencies, and state education agencies moving forward.  

# Contributions
Contributions are restricted to staff of [Fayette County Public Schools](http://www.fcps.net).  However, pull requests may still be submitted and if adopted by the office the appropriate credit for authorship will be noted for those changes.
