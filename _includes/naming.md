## <a name="naming"></a> 3. Naming Conventions

In this section, we describe the naming conventions used for raw and aggregated data.  These conventions can be expected to be stable over time and are intended for use by FCPS staff and research partners.

### <a name="nameStyle"></a> Naming Style

Whenever possible, we will try to use the fewest characters possible to unambiguously identify a datum.  This often requires several combinations of letters to be used in order to construct standardized names conforming to our naming conventions.  The sections below provide information about cases where static definitions exist (e.g., <a href="#demographics">Demographic Data</a>) and cases where the names are constructed from combinations of discrete pieces of information to identify the meaning of the datum (e.g., <a href="#assessment">Assessment Data</a>).  There are some common elements that are used to construct meaning as prefix or suffix elements:

Table. <em>Common Prefixes and Suffixes Used in Naming Conventions</em>

Prefix/Suffix | Meaning 
-------------- | ---------
sch | School
dist | District
id | Identifier/ID Number
std | Student
tch | Teacher
pct | Percent
n | Number/Count
nm | Name
yr | Year

### <a name="assessment"></a> Assessment Data
We use a simple grammar for our assessment variables that can be defined with a regular expression: `(([a-z]{3}){2}) ([a-z]{2,3})([0-9]{1,2})?(item[0-9]{1,2})?`.  This expression translates into a grammar to represent discrete pieces of the information that can be used to uniquely identify the data of interest: `testCode + subjectCode + scoreCode [ + # ] [ + item# ]`; in this example, we use the square brackets to denote optional information that is used to extend the base grammar to additional use cases.

We've provided some tables below that can help you to understand the naming conventions based on the grammatical role identified previously (e.g., testCode, subjectCode, etc...).
